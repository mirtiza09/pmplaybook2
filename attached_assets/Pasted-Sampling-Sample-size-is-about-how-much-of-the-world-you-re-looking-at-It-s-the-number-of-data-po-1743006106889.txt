Sampling

Sample size is about how much of the world you’re looking at. It’s the number of data points you’re using to draw conclusions. Like trying to guess the average height of people in a city by measuring a few folks on the street. The more people you measure, the more confident you can estimate. 

One of the biggest mistakes we can make is drawing conclusions from too small a sample ­size—​­ like trying to guess a puzzle picture from only a few pieces. In most instances, increasing our sample size gives us valuable information that lets us see our situation in a new light. The catch is that large sample sizes are expensive. It takes time and money to collect all that data. So practitioners and researchers are always balancing the need for precision with the constraints of budget and deadline. They’ll often settle for the smallest sample size that can still give them a statistically significant result.

Using this model means exploring what isn’t obvious and knowing how easy it is to corrupt our samples with bias. 

The next time you hear a statistic, think about the sample size. It’ll give you a clue about how seriously to take it. Remember: the larger the sample, the closer to the truth.

Randomness

Randomness is the chaos that underlies the cosmos. It’s the unpredictable, the uncontrollable, the stuff that doesn’t follow any discernible pattern.

Randomness is what makes life surprising. It’s why you can’t predict the future with certainty. You might make plans, but there’s always the possibility of a random event throwing a wrench in the works. A flat tire, a chance encounter, a sudden inspiration. Randomness is the spice that keeps things interesting.

The tricky thing about randomness is that humans are terrible at recognizing it. We see patterns where there are none. We attribute meaning to coincidence. We think we can beat the odds. But true randomness is immune to our predictions and superstitions. It doesn’t care about our theories or desires

Regression To The Mean

Regression to the mean is the universe’s way of saying “not so fast.” It’s the tendency for extreme outcomes to be followed by more average ones. Extreme results are rarely repeated. 

The next time you see something extraordinary, enjoy it. But remember, it probably won’t last. Sooner or later, regression to the mean will come calling, pulling the exceptional back to the ordinary. That’s the way the universe keeps things in check.

Multiply by Zero

Multiplying by zero is the mathematical version of the Midas touch in reverse. Everything it touches turns to nothing. No matter how big or small a number is, when you multiply it by zero, you get zero. It’s the ultimate reset button. 

Multiplying by zero shows that we must be mindful of the zeros that will negate our other efforts. Just as in engineering, where one faulty component can make an entire system fail, not being reliable can have the same effect in life. 

When you multiply by zero, everything else becomes irrelevant.
