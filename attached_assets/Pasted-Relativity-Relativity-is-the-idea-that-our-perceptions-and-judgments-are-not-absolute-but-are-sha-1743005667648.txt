Relativity

Relativity is the idea that our perceptions and judgments are not absolute but are shaped by our unique vantage points and frames of reference. It’s the understanding that our experiences are subjective.

We each inhabit a particular web of experiences. This context shapes how we see the world, what we notice and overlook, and what we value and dismiss. Two people can look at the same event and come away with vastly different interpretations based on their unique frames of reference.

Consider two people standing in the same room: They each experience the same absolute temperature differently. One can feel hot while the other feels cold, even though the temperature is the same. Similarly, consider political debates: Our beliefs are shaped by our unique experiences and social contexts. A policy that seems like common sense to an urban progressive might feel like complete nonsense to a rural conservative, and vice versa. In this way, understanding relativity is key to fostering empathy and finding common ground. However, relativity is not the same as relativism—­ the idea that all perspectives are equally valid.

Recognizing the relativity of our perceptions doesn’t mean we don’t have to make judgments about validity. Instead, it’s a call to examine our assumptions, seek out diverse perspectives, and expand our frames of reference. We all have blind spots—­things we cannot see. Understanding that our perceptions are relative allows us to open ourselves to other ways of seeing. If you’re wondering where to get started, try asking others what they see that you can’t. Apply your judgment to their responses and update your beliefs accordingly.

Reciprocity

Reciprocity underlies everything from basic human kindness to the most complex systems of trade. At its core, reciprocity is the simple idea of treating others as they treat us—giving what we get. But from this simple principle grows a vast web of social interactions and expectations that shapes nearly every aspect of our lives.

Many people expect the world to just hand them things without effort. This is a poor strategy because it doesn’t align with the human behavior you can observe around you every day. Reciprocation teaches us that you are likely to receive the same if you give people cynicism and curtness or nothing at all. But if you give people an opportunity and the benefit of the doubt, you will, more often than not, be on the receiving end of the same behavior.

Become what you want to see in the world, and the world will return it to you. If you want an amazing relationship with your partner, be an amazing partner. If you want people to be thoughtful and kind to you, be thoughtful and kind to them. If you want people to listen to you, listen to them.

The best way to achieve success is to deserve success. Small changes in your actions change your entire world.

One of the biggest misperceptions about reciprocity is that people should sit around waiting for others to go first rather than unlocking the power of reciprocity in their favor by going positive and going first without expectation.

Reciprocity reminds us that our actions tend to come back on us. It’s an essential reminder that we are part of the world, and thus, our actions do not happen in isolation but are instead part of an interconnected web of effects.

Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the science of energy, heat, and work. It’s the set of physical laws that govern how energy moves and changes in the universe. Chances are, when you first came across the subject, it was dry, full of equations and abstract concepts. But the truth is thermodynamics is a useful intellectual framework for daily life. Not only can it reveal why your room gets messier over time, but it also explains why you should choose your friends wisely.

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This means that every joule of energy in the universe, every bit of heat and work and motion is part of an unbroken chain stretching back to the Big Bang.

When you hop on a flight that burns jet fuel, you’re tapping into energy captured by plants millions of years ago and stored in chemical bonds until it was transformed into heat and motion.

But while energy is conserved, it’s not always useful. That’s where the second law of thermodynamics comes in. It states that entropy—­ a measure of disorder—­ increases over time in any closed system. In other words, left on its own, the universe tends toward chaos. Your bedroom doesn’t clean itself—­ it takes energy and effort to maintain order. Stars burn out, structures crumble, and ice melts into water.

Entropy is the universe’s tax on time. The constant battle against entropy is the driving force behind much of what we do. The constant struggle between order and disorder is the source of change and progress.

While engineers and scientists use thermodynamics to design engines or calculate the energy requirements of a system, we can use it as a framework for understanding the deep interconnectedness of everything. When you feel the sun’s warmth on your skin, you’re experiencing the result of a thermodynamic process that began in the heart of a star ninety-three million miles away. When you watch a campfire burn down to embers, you’re witnessing the inexorable march of entropy in real-time.

Thermodynamics is the story of energy across time. We’re part of an energy story that stretches back to the dawn of time and reaches the farthest pockets of space. We can marvel that in a universe ruled by disorder, pockets of temporary order can emerge, whether it’s a clean room, a planet, or a civilization.

By understanding thermodynamics, we gain not just a technical toolbox but an appreciation for the beauty, complexity, and fragility of our very existence.
