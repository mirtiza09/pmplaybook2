The Map is Not the Territory

The map is not the territory reminds us that our mental models of the world are not the same as the world itself. It cautions against confusing our abstractions and representations with the complex, ever-­shifting reality they aim to describe.

It is dangerous to mistake the map for the territory. Consider the person with an outstanding résumé who checks all the boxes on paper but can’t do the job.

Updating our maps is a difficult process of reconciling what we want to be true with what is true.

In many areas of life, we are offered maps by other people. We are reliant on the maps provided by experts, pundits, and teachers. In these cases, the best we can do is to choose our mapmakers wisely and to seek out those who are rigorous, transparent, and open to revision.

Ultimately, the map/territory distinction invites us to engage with the world as it is, not just as we imagine it. And remember, when you don’t make the map, choose your cartographer wisely.

Circle of Competence

The first rule of competition is that you are more likely to win if you play where you have an advantage. Playing to your advantage requires a firm understanding of what you know and don’t know.

Your circle of competence is your personal sphere of expertise, where your knowledge and skills are concentrated. It’s the domain where you have a deep understanding, where your judgments are reliable, and your decisions are sound. 

The size of your circle isn’t as important as knowing the boundaries. The wise person knows the limits of their knowledge and can confidently say, “This falls within my circle,” or “This is outside my area of expertise.” 

While operating within your circle of competence is a recipe for confidence and effectiveness, venturing outside your circle of competence is a recipe for trouble. You’re like a sailor navigating unfamiliar waters without a map, at the mercy of currents and storms you don’t fully understand. This isn’t to say that you should never venture outside your circle. Learning new things, gaining new skills, and mastering new domains is one of the most beautiful things about life. 

Celebrate your expertise, but also acknowledge your limitations.

First Principles Thinking

First principles thinking is the art of breaking down complex problems into their fundamental truths. It’s a way of thinking that goes beyond the surface and allows us to see things from a new perspective.

Thinking in first principles allows us to identify the root causes, strip away the layers of complexity, and focus on the most effective solutions. Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside the way things have always been done and instead see what is possible.

First principles thinking is not easy. It requires a willingness to challenge the status quo. This is why it’s often the domain of rebels and disrupters who believe there must be a better way. It’s the thinking of those willing to start from scratch and build from the ground up.

In a world focused on incremental improvement, first principles thinking offers a competitive advantage because almost no one does it.
